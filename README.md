# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

We were asked to analysis PyBer data using Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. We were asked to create a dataframe that contains a summary of the data based on the city type and a graph which shows the weekly fares by each city type. With the results, we will analyze how the data is different based on the city type and how we can make decisions based on our findings.
